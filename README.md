# 6502 computer

These are the project files for my version of [Ben Eater's 6502 computer](https://eater.net/6502).

## Getting started

- Install VSCode and Arduino IDE V2 (I couldn't get the online editor to work reliably with the serial interface)
- Install MADS extension for nice assembly highlighting

## Future plans

- Change interrupt behavior to reduce lag
- What to do with other switches
- Fix flickering in interrupt script
- Turn into a PCB: https://www.reddit.com/r/beneater/comments/dgcpt3/i_made_a_pcb_version_of_ben_eaters_6502_computer/
- Change LCD interface from 8 pins to 4
- Automatic power-on reset
- Emulator: starting in PHP, or https://www.reddit.com/r/beneater/comments/phn3sd/started_work_on_an_emulator_for_my_6502_tms9918/
- Bootloader or something to avoid having to pop and flash the EEPROM for every change: https://github.com/janroesner/sixty5o2
- Space Invaders: https://www.reddit.com/r/beneater/comments/phn3sd/started_work_on_an_emulator_for_my_6502_tms9918/
