# 6502 computer

These are the project files for my version of [Ben Eater's 6502 computer](https://eater.net/6502).

## Getting started

- Install VSCode and Arduino IDE V2 (I couldn't get the online editor to work reliably with the serial interface)
- Install MADS extension for nice assembly highlighting

## Future plans

- What to do with other switches
- Interrupt doesn't print decimals beyond 9
- Turn into a PCB
- Change LCD interface from 8 pins to 4
- Automatic power-on reset
- Bootloader or something to avoid having to pop and flash the EEPROM for every change
- Run actual-ish 80s era software??
