# DP6502 Emulator

This is a PHP-based emulator for my version of Ben Eater’s 6502 computer.

## Why write an emulator from scratch?

For the lulz and just to see if I can. I didn’t say it would be any good. I’m not using any existing emulators as reference, [clean-room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design) design is more challenging and therefore more fun.

## Okay, but why PHP?

- It’s my daily language
- I enjoy a challenge
- It’s the world’s first PHP-based 6502 emulator
- I’m delighted to introduce a new namespace collision into the world (via the [PHP OpCode](https://sites.google.com/site/6502asembly/6502-instruction-set/php)

## Okay, but seriously... why PHP?

I don’t judge your lifestyle choices, don’t judge mine. :smile:
